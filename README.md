## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Search Implementation

The search functionality is implemented using Whoosh, an efficient pure-Python full-text indexing and search library. The search engine:

1. Creates an inverted index mapping words to document locations
2. Uses a schema with document ID, filename, page number, and content fields
3. Implements BM25 ranking algorithm for improved result relevance
4. Extracts and highlights matching content with surrounding context
5. Provides pagination and result grouping features

### PDF Processing

PDF processing is handled by PyMuPDF (Fitz):

1. Extracts text content from PDF documents page by page
2. Preserves page structure for accurate context retrieval
3. Stores extracted text in JSON format for efficient retrieval
4. Maps document metadata to search index for result generation

### UI Implementation

The user interface features modern design elements:

1. Responsive layout using custom CSS
2. Premium animations and transitions using CSS and JavaScript
3. Glassmorphism effects with semi-transparent backgrounds and blur
4. Dynamic 3D hover effects with perspective transformations
5. Micro-interactions for enhanced user experience

## üîç Advanced Usage

### Query Syntax

The search engine supports complex query operators:

- **Term searching**: `keyword`
- **Phrase searching**: `"exact phrase"`
- **Field-specific searching**: `filename:document.pdf content:keyword`
- **Boolean operators**: `term1 AND term2`, `term1 OR term2`, `NOT term`
- **Wildcard searching**: `key*` (prefix search)

### Batch Processing

For large document collections:

1. Place PDF files in the `pdfs/` directory
2. Use the "Process All Documents" function on the dashboard
3. All documents will be extracted and indexed in batch

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Not Searchable**: Some PDFs contain scanned images instead of text. These require OCR processing before they can be searched.

2. **Search Index Corruption**: If search results become inconsistent, you may need to rebuild the index:
   - Navigate to Dashboard > Process All Documents to rebuild the index

3. **Large File Handling**: For extremely large PDFs (>50MB), processing may take longer. The application will continue to function during processing.

### Data Management

The application stores data in several locations:

- **PDF Files**: Original PDF documents in `/pdfs` directory
- **Extracted Text**: Text content in `/data` directory as JSON files
- **Search Index**: Whoosh index in `/index` directory
- **Temporary Files**: Temporary exports in `/static/temp` directory

To clear data and start fresh:
1. Stop the application
2. Delete contents of the `data/`, `index/`, and `static/temp/` directories
3. Restart the application and reprocess documents
